New type of invasive brain-computer interface - "Nano-based dynamically diluted brain interface" (NDDBI), which will not require surgical operation. Instead, it will leverage methods used in Nano-medicine for delivering nanoparticles to certain areas of the human body and techniques developed in positron emission tomography for studying distribution of neuro-mediators in the brain. NDDBI can be used for novel brain to machine interfaces (BMI) which can provide new ways for mental performance enhancements, provide new therapies for brain trauma, drug obsession as well as treat neurological disorders such as Autism and Parkinson’s disease. The current methods like injecting electrodes and syringe-injectable electronics might require surgical operations or does not provide a clear way to remove electronics from brain tissue if something goes wrong. Unlike those approaches, NDDBI provide a way to establish temporal two-ways wireless brain computer interface which will dissolve over the time of a few hours. This ability to dissolve is important advantage of NDDBI over to current BMI methods.

NDDBI uses metallic (gold, platinum, etc.) and magnetic nanoparticles coated with neurotransmitters such as: noradrenaline, dopamine (dihydroxyphenylalanine), or a precursor such as L-DOPA to target specific cells in the brain. The unique optical, magnetic, and chemical properties of nanoparticles will be used for laser induced thermal excitation of neurons. Also those particles will serve for contrast enhancement, increased sensitivity and better spatial, and temporal information, across MRI, PET, SPECT, and ultrasound multi-functionality and multi-modal imaging. It has been demonstrated that nanoparticles a few nanometers in diameter can cross the blood-brain barrier to reach various parts of the brain [1-2]. In addition, neurotransmitters bind to receptors of specific neural cells; providing a mechanism to selectively attach nanoparticles to certain cell types.

Once specific cells in the brain are targeted using nanoparticles, NDDBI can selectively activate sections of the brain by controlling neuron firing with IR light or ultrasound. Nanoparticles can be heated by external infrared light (or ultrasound) focused on a certain part of the brain. Light heating of a neuron on a fraction of a degree will reduce neural membrane polarization, which will lead to changes in neuron firing [3, 4]. To achieve this with NDDBI, multiple beams are positioned around the head and focus on one region, which leads to better localization and reduce intensity of light exposure. In this process a “warm” spot is created, while delivering a small amount of light into the tissue.

NDDBI includes the ability to leverage nanoparticles as a contrast agent for EEG/EMG/FMRI recordings [5,6,7]. Injecting nanoparticle agents coated with neuromodulators will enhances detection of brain activity from targeted regions. The nanoparticles serve as an interface between the brain tissue and computer.  

We call this interface “Dynamically Diluted Brain Interfaces” referring to the processes of washing out of nanoparticles from the body. This process depend on types of nanoparticles but has been demonstrated taking from 2 to up to 17 hours [8]. Thus NDDBI will not stay in the body permanently and will be cleansed out of the body in a few hour.

NDDBI will allow enhance brain processing power by interfacing with external cyberinfrastructure.  In addition, it will provide a new way to treat a variety of disorders associated with brain pathology. NDDBI can be used to activate parts of the brain that impact growth and neuronal plasticity and therefore it is a new tool for the treatment of traumatic brain injuries. NDDBI can even lead to new therapeutic approaches to treat drug addiction and diseases such as schizophrenia, autism, or tumor lesions that have functional effects on the pain perception process.
